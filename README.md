      THE MAIN PURPOSE OF USING CRYPTOGRAPHY IN TODAY'S WORLD IS TO SECURE THE DATA.THE AIM OF 
OUR PROJECT IS TO SECURE THE DATA IN WRITTEN SEPARATELY.

THIS ALGORITHM TAKES DATA OF 128 BITS.THAT IS IT TAKES ONLY FOUR CHARACTERS OF DATA.IT SPLITS INTO TWO PARTS AS TWO BLOCKS WITH EACH 
64 BITS.

128->64->32

128 BITS -1
64 BITS -2
32 BITS -4  AS K[0],K[1],K[2],K[3] { 4 CHARACTERS OF DATA }

DECLARING TWO VARIABLES V1,V2 AND ALSO SUM

V1=0
V2=0
SUM=0

DELTA = 02ACh
